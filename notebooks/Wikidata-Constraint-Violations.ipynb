    "## Supported Violation Types\n",
    "\n",
    "At this time, violation triples are generated for the following constraint types: \n",
    "* Allowed-entity-type constraint (Q52004125); Violations indicate that the property should not be used with/is invalid for the entity\n",
    "  * There is no optional_other_property_or_value\n",
    "* Conflicts-with constraint (Q21502838); Violations indicate that the semantics of two different properties are not logical/not consistent for the item, and therefore the properties should not be used together\n",
    "  * The “conflicting” property is referenced by the predicate, wikidata-owl:conflictingProperty\n",
    "* Contemporary constraint (Q25796498); Violations indicate that the subject and object of the property triple should coexist at some point in time but do not\n",
    "  * The other entity which is not contemporary is referenced by the predicate, wikidata-owl:nonContemporaryWith \n",
    "* Format constraint (Q21502404); Violations indicate that there is a formatting error in the property value\n",
    "  * There is no optional_other_property_or_value\n",
    "  * Further work is needed to extract the regex expression defining the format from the property's constraint definition (format identified by the predicate, pq:P1793)\n",
    "* Integer constraint (Q52848401); Violations indicate that the property value should be an integer but is not\n",
    "  * There is no optional_other_property_or_value\n",
    "* Inverse constraint (Q21510855); Violations indicate that there is only a triple defined relating the subject to the object, but a corresponding triple in the reverse direction should exist\n",
    "  * The other entity which should have an inverse relationship is referenced by the predicate, wikidata-owl:missedInverse\n",
    "  * Futher work would be needed to obtain the property defined as the “inverse”, which is referenced by the predicate, pq:P2306, in the original property's constraint definition\n",
    "* None-of constraint (Q52558054); Violations indicate that the property value is erroneous, a better alternative exists or should not be used for other reasons\n",
    "  * The invalid property value is referenced by the predicate, wikidata-owl:invalidItem\n",
    "* One-of constraint (Q21510859); Violations indicate that the property value (the object of the property triple) is not defined as an item from a predefined set, and therefore is erroneous\n",
    "  * The entity that is referenced by the property but has an invalid value is specified using the predicate, wikidata-owl:invalidItem (which is not declared if the referenced entity is not an instance or subclass of some item)\n",
    "  * Further work is needed to obtain the allowed instance of/subclass of types, which are specified using the predicate, pq:P2305, in the original property’s constraint definition\n",
    "* Item-requires-statement constraint (Q21503247); Violations indicate that the item using the property does not itself declare a triple with another, specific predicate, or that the triple is declared but its property value is not one of a predefined set (as an example of the latter, if an item’s Google Knowledge Graph ID (P2671) value is a string and not a graph reference, then the item would carry this violation) \n",
    "  * The missing property declaration or declaration with an invalid item value is specified using the predicate, wikidata-owl:missingOrInvalidProperty\n",
    "  * The allowed item value(s) for the wikidata-owl:missingOrInvalidProperty are provided using the predicate, wikidata-owl:allowedValue\n",
    "* Single-value constraint (Q19474404); Violations indicate that more than one value is defined for a property that should be single-valued\n",
    "  * There is no optional_other_property_or_value\n",
    "* Subject-type constraint (Q21503250); Violations indicate that the referencing entity (the subject of the property triple) is not a subclass or instance of one of the required types\n",
    "  * The allowed item value(s) are referenced by the predicate, wikidata-owl:allowedValue\n",
    "  * The current, invalid type(s) for the item are referenced by the predicate, wikidata-owl:invalidItem (which is not declared if the referenced entity is not an instance or subclass of some item)\n",
    "* Symmetric constraint (Q2510862); Violations indicate that the subject/object of the property triple should also be defined reversing the order (e.g., object – property – subject), but is not\n",
    "  * The other entity which is missing a triple relating it to the original subject is referenced by the predicate, wikidata-owl:missedSymmetric\n",
    "* Unique-value constraint (Q21502410); Violations indicate that the combination of the property and value should be relevant for only one item, but is used with multiples\n",
    "  * The duplicated value is given by the predicate, wikidata-owl:duplicatedValue, or if the value is a string, by the predicated, wikidata-owl:duplicatedStringValue \n",
    "  * Note that a violation triple is defined for _each item_ that uses the property-value pair, which enables querying for all entities with that value \n",
    "* Value-type constraint (Q21510865); Violations indicate that the referenced entity (the object of the property triple) is not a subclass or instance of one of the required types\n",
    "  * The allowed item value(s) are referenced by the predicate, wikidata-owl:allowedValue\n",
    "  * The invalid referenced object is identified using the predicate, wikidata-owl:invalidItem\n"
